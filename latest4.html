         <p>Pampanga Governor Dennis “Delta” Pineda has ordered the suspension of face-to-face classes on October 16-17 in the province due to a nationwide transport strike.</p>

<p>Executive Order No. 32-2023, which Pineda issued, covers all levels in public and private schools in Pampanga.</p>

<p>“In anticipation of the effects of the lack of public transportation to commuters especially to students and school personnel, it is deemed necessary to implement the suspension of face-to-face classes,” he said.</p>

<p>In order to avoid disruption in the academic calendar, Pineda urged the educational institutions to implement online, modular classes, or any alternative learning delivery modality applicable during those two days.</p>

<p>Transport group Malayang Alyansa ng Bus Employees at Laborers (MANIBELA) has announced its plan to conduct a nationwide transport strike starting October 16.</p>

<p>The group will protest the alleged corruption in the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and the government’s public utility modernization program.</p>

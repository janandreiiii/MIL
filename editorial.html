<h1>Inflation, shrinkflation</h1>
        <center><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.philstar.com%2Fphotos%2F2022%2F08%2F06%2Fedi_2022-08-06_22-38-58.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=dd252873a9f52ea7b323ee4bc1fda5a3c75fb2bcb3330b765092c288dfece95d&ipo=images" position="center" width="621.36px" height="349.52px"></center>
        <p>These days, people are talking not only about more contagious COVID subvariants but also high inflation and its “variants” such as stagflation. As purchasing power and the sizes or portions of staples such as pan de sal shrink, Filipinos have coined the terms “shrinkflation” and “skimpflation.”</p>

<p>The problems give greater urgency for fiscal prudence and efficient management all around, from national agencies to local government units that now have a greater share of national revenues.</p>

<p>The new government faces enormous challenges, a number of them beyond its control. These include surging fuel prices due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the aggressive moves of the US Federal Reserve to tame inflation, which have weakened the peso and prompted the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas to raise interest rates at the risk of dampening economic growth.</p>

      <br><br>
      ANGELES CITY, PAMPANGA – Juan D. Nepomuceno Sons, Inc (JDN), developer of township Nepo Center, a homegrown chain of community malls and office spaces, takes pride in hosting Nepo Music Festival, dubbed NMF2023, a first in a series of new traditions in the heart of Angeles City.
      JDN brings together Filipino music artists in a bid to raise funds to fuel its mission further to help the community. Its North Star has always been about helping the community. So, all net proceeds will go to JDN Uplift Foundation – JDN’s charitable trust, which supports various worthy causes such as the city’s heritage landmark, Holy Rosary Parish Church (HRPC).
      <br><br>
      HRPC, affectionately called “Pisamban Maragul” by the locals, stands in the heart of the city and calls for donations to rebuild its structure since it suffered devastating damage when a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 struck the country’s main island, Luzon in April of 2019.

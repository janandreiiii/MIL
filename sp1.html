    The Pampanga Giant Lanterns advanced to the 2023 MPBL Southern Division semifinals after an impressive 81-61 triumph over the Marikina Shoemasters in Game 2 of the quarterfinals on Friday night at the Caloocan Sports Complex.

    Justine Baltazar, who bounced back from a subpar Game 1, was the star of the night, finishing with 22 points, 11 rebounds, and five assists as the Giant Lanterns secured a 2-0 series victory over the Shoemasters.

    Arwind Santos added 13 points, including two three-pointers, and Michael John Garcia contributed 13 points, four rebounds, and four assists for Pampanga.

    "My performance in Game 1 wasn't up to the mark, so I needed to bounce back this game," Baltazar said. "But I couldn't have done it without the help of my teammates."

    The Giant Lanterns turned the game around after trailing 8-12 early on, with seven straight points from John Bryle Bahio and inside baskets from Baltazar, establishing a commanding 46-30 lead after a Santos three-pointer.

    Although the Shoemasters showed resilience in the third quarter, narrowing the lead to 13 points, the Giant Lanterns pulled away in the fourth quarter, led by Garcia and Santos, extending their lead to 20 points.

    Mark Atabay finished with a double-double of 16 points and 13 rebounds, leading the Marikina Shoemasters.

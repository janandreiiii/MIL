    ANGELES CITY — A colorful and festive Kambal Festival transformed the streets of this city over the weekend. Mayor Carmelo “Pogi” Lazatin Jr. led the celebration on October 7 onboard a float made of indigenous and recyclable materials. "This is in line with our celebration of Fiestang Kuliat, bringing the importance of these momentous occasions closer to our constituents," Lazatin said. Actor Diego Loyzaga, Mutya Ning Angeles 2022 Joanne Marie Thornley, and the 19 official candidates of MNA 2023 also joined the parade. Some 18 pairs of twins from 13 barangays with their respective floats and street dancers from 12 public schools were featured during the Kambal Festival. The participants were classified as Category A and Category B — seven pairs of twins in the latter and 11 in the former. Lazatin lauded the hard work of the Kambal Festival committee, which gave indescribable fun to the community, coinciding with the city's Fiesta theme of "Keni't Magsaya king Angeles tripling Fiesta!" The committee is led by Chief Adviser IC Calaguas and Executive Assistant IV Reina Manuel, with the City Engineer's Office and Environment Management System led by Engr. Donato Dizon, Angeles City Tourism Office headed by Anneleen Antonio-Sugui; Gender and Development Office led by Mina Cabiles, Angeles City Tourism Auxiliary, Barangay Outreach Program; and Angeles City Command Center governed by Michael Lising, Angeles City Economic Development Investment and Promotions Office led by Irish Bonus-Llego, City Nutrition Office headed by Jermaine Jam Aguila, Sharmaine Vianne Gonzales, Anne Salonga, and Rachelle Oloya of Mayor's Office and staff, Angeles City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office led by Rodolfo Simeon, Angeles City Traffic Development Office led by Francis Pangilinan, Angeles City Police Office, and City Information Office. Lazatin also thanked the Beautéderm Corporation, led by President and Chief Executive Officer Rei Anicoche-Tan, for the continuous support of the event. This is the third Kambal Festival celebration during the stint of Lazatin, where the appearance of twin participants and creative floats await recognition and prizes.

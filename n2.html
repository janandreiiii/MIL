  <h1>Arwind Santos Takes on Dual Role as Commissioner and Player</h1>
  <br>
  <p>
    <strong>PAMPANGA, Philippines (AP)</strong> &mdash; Arwind Santos, a former PBA Most Valuable Player, is set to embark on a unique journey as he takes on the role of commissioner in the <em>National Basketball Championship Inter-High League</em>, all while continuing his career as a player in the MPBL.
  </p>

  <p>
    Santos's decision to join the MPBL squad, Pampanga Green Lanterns, as a late signee has created excitement in the basketball community. His dual responsibilities reflect his commitment to the sport.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the commissioner of the <em>National Basketball Championship Inter-High (NBCIH)</em>, Santos will play a pivotal role in a new league aimed at discovering the top secondary school basketball team in the country. This endeavor follows Santos's recent impressive performance, where he contributed 4 points and six rebounds in a starting role, leading the top-seeded Pampanga to an 82-70 victory over Marikina in Game 1 of their MPBL quarterfinals.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I'm thrilled to embrace this role as it's an opportunity I owe to a higher power," expressed Santos in Filipino at the league's press conference in Mabalacat. "I am deeply grateful for the chance to positively impact young athletes, not only in Pampanga but throughout the entire country."
  </p>

  <p>
    Santos also emphasized, "I'm optimistic that this commitment won't be short-lived. I hope to facilitate the development of a continuous stream of talented athletes who can be mentored and guided toward success."
  </p>

  <p>
    The <em>National Basketball Championship Inter-High League</em> is scheduled to commence on Friday, October 13, at the Bren Z. Guiao Convention Center in San Fernando, Pampanga. Eight Kapampangan schools will engage in a do-or-die competition to secure the honor of representing their province in the grand finals. Notable matchups include St. Augustine Institute of Pampanga versus Don Bosco Academy, and St. Vincent Academy of Apalit against Sta. Cruz Academy of Lubao.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition, fans can look forward to captivating showdowns as Pampanga Colleges takes on Holy Angel University, and St. Mary's Academy of Guagua faces off against Guagua National College.
  </p>

  <p>
    Following the Pampanga leg, the competition will venture into a series of three-day knockout games across 15 other regions in Luzon, including Cagayan Province, Ilocos, Pangasinan, and the National Capital Region. The excitement will also extend to Visayas and Mindanao, with eight regions participating, including Bohol, Leyte, Cebu, Iloilo, Cagayan de Oro, Butuan, Zamboanga, and Davao City.
  </p>

  <p>
    The prestigious competition, organized by <strong>Jams Sports</strong>, a subsidiary of <strong>Jamsap Entertainment Corporation</strong>, will award the grand champion a substantial cash prize of P1 million. After the culmination of the Pampanga leg, enthusiasts can follow the action through live broadcasts on <strong>Jamsap TV</strong> and online streaming via the <strong>Jamsap Entertainment app</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    "We have high hopes that the <em>NBCIH</em> will serve as a stepping stone for aspiring athletes to achieve their dreams of earning college scholarships while pursuing their passion for the game," articulated Jojo Flores, the esteemed chief executive officer of Jamsap.

<p>Arwind Santos will serve as commissioner of the new National Basketball
  Championship Inter-High League in addition to his job as a player in the MPBL.</p>

<p>PAMPANGA, Philippines (AP) â€” Arwind Santos, a former PBA Most Valuable
  Player, will juggle two duties after joining MPBL squad Pampanga Green
  Lanterns as a late signee.</p>

<p>Santos will serve as commissioner of the National Basketball Championship
  Inter-High (NBCIH), a new league dedicated to finding the best secondary
  school team in the country, just days after tallying 4 points and six rebounds
  in a starting role for top-seeded Pampanga in an 82-70 win over Marikina in
  Game 1 of their MPBL quarterfinals.</p>

<p>"I'm happy [to take the role] because I always leave my opportunities to God,"
  Santos stated in Filipino at the league's press conference here in Mabalacat.
  "I am thankful for the opportunity to help young athletes not just in Pampanga but the whole country,"
  he said.</p>

<p>"I hope this won't be a short-term [deal], so we can have a steady stream of athletes that can be guided correctly."</p>

<p>The league will begin on Friday, October 13, at the Bren Z. Guiao Convention
  Center in San Fernando, Pampanga, with eight Kapampangan schools competing in
  a do-or-die format for the right to represent their province in the grand
  finals. St. Augustine Institute of Pampanga will compete against Don Bosco
  Academy, while St. Vincent Academy of Apalit will compete against Sta. Cruz
  Academy of Lubao.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Pampanga Colleges will square off against Holy Angel University,
  and St. Mary's Academy of Guagua will square off against Guagua National
  College.</p>

<p>Following the Pampanga leg, there will be three days of knockout games in 15
  other areas in Luzon, including Cagayan Province, Ilocos, Pangasinan, and the
  National Capital Region, as well as eight in Visayas and Mindanao, including
  Bohol, Leyte, Cebu, Iloilo, Cagayan de Oro, Butuan, Zamboanga, and Davao City.</p>

<p>The competition, created by Jams Sports, a subsidiary of Jamsap Entertainment
  Corporation, will give the grand champion a P1 million cash prize. After the
  Pampanga leg, the games will be televised live on Jamsap TV and streamed on
  the Jamsap Entertainment app.</p>

<p>"We are hoping the NBCIH can help young athletes to fulfill or jumpstart their dreams of earning college scholarships while pursuing their passion for the game,"
  stated Jojo Flores, chief executive officer of Jamsap</p>

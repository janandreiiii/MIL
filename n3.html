            <p>
                <strong>MANILA, Philippines (UPI)</strong> â€” On the third and
                final reading, the House of Representatives adopted a bill
                designating Pampanga as the country's "Christmas Capital" on
                Monday.
            </p>
         
            <p>
                House Bill No. 6933, sponsored by Speaker Ferdinand Martin
                Romualdez and Pampanga 3rd District Rep. Aurelio "Dong" Gonzales
                Jr., was approved unanimously by all 250 lawmakers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Section 2 of the proposed law directs the Department of Tourism
                to incorporate and highlight the province as the Christmas
                Capital in its national and regional marketing campaigns.
            </p>

            <p>
                "The Christmas season here in the Philippines is made extra special every year by the Kapampangans, who take pride in their famous and vibrant tradition of lantern-making,"
                Romualdez stated in an e-mail.
            </p>

            <p>
                "It's only fitting that we formalize Pampanga's legacy as the Christmas Capital of the Philippines now, as it continues to brighten the season of giving each year,"
                Gonzales added.

            <h2>Commuter Fares Increase for Traditional and Modern Public
                Utility Jeepneys</h2>
            <p>SAN FERNANDO CITY — Traditional and modern public utility
                jeepneys (PUJ) will charge an additional peso in commuter fares
                starting from October 8, 2023.</p>
            <p>This decision comes after the Land Transportation Franchising and
                Regulatory Board (LTFRB) approved a "provisional" fare hike of
                ₱1 on Tuesday.</p>
            <p>The Pangkalahatang Sanggunian Manila and Suburbs Drivers
                Association Nationwide, Inc., Alliance of Transport Operators
                and Drivers Association of the Philippines, and Alliance of
                Concerned Transport Organization have been asked to submit a
                supplemental petition regarding their proposal for a ₱5 fare
                increase for the first four kilometers and an additional ₱1 for
                subsequent kilometers.</p>
            <p>The LTFRB has clarified that it has approved a ₱1 fare increase
                for the first four kilometers but not for subsequent kilometers.</p>
            <p>This ₱1 increase is considered "temporary" until the LTFRB makes
                a final decision on the groups' primary petition.</p>
            <p>As a result of the temporary rise, the minimum fare for classic
                PUJs will be ₱13, and for contemporary jeepneys, it will be ₱15.</p>
            <p>The LTFRB has urged public transportation companies to continue
                providing discounts to senior citizens, people with impairments,
                and students, as required by law.</p>

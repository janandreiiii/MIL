        <h2>San Fernando Electric Light and Power Company (SFELAPCO) Urges Prudence in Utility Pole Usage</h2>
        <p><strong>San Fernando City:</strong> When using electricity posts, utility and telecommunications firms should exercise prudence and follow the rules, according to the San Fernando Electric Light and Power Company (SFELAPCO).</p>

        <br>

        <p>
            This reminder is in response to complaints of minor grounding and improper installations close to power poles, which have led to SFELAPCO being held accountable.
            SFELAPCO strongly advises utility companies with whom it has a joint pole agreement (JPA) to adhere to rules for the installation and upkeep of telephone lines and cables on power posts that are currently in place.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Investigations into the moderate grounding events on residential properties have revealed that the reason is poor installation work by cable or telecommunications professionals. "We always remind utility installers to use caution while using electric posts. Although, regrettably, we are being held accountable for these incidents," SFELAPCO stated that they are dedicated to ensuring that all of their clients are secure.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>The electricity voltage on power posts that supply residential consumers is typically much lower than that of the transmission lines. This does not, however, lessen the risks that could arise from treating these posts improperly. According to SFELAPCO, improper installation or maintenance might still result in fatalities or significant injuries.</p>


        <br>
        
        <p>Regarding managing electric posts, SFELAPCO emphasizes how crucial it is to provide technicians or outside installers from cable or telecoms firms with the appropriate training. These experts must understand the associated dangers and safety precautions. The power company emphasized that potential risks can be reduced by exercising diligence and caution at all times, guaranteeing the security of installers and clients alike.</p>


        <br>
        
        <p>SFELAPCO urges utility and telecommunications firms to follow established procedures and prioritize safety. This includes giving professionals the know-how and abilities to securely install and maintain cables and phone wires on electricity posts. In addition, it warned that if any more problems like this arise, the joint pole agreement should be canceled.</p>

        <br>
        
        <p>To guarantee that installers are informed of best practices and any modifications to legislation, it also underlined the necessity of ongoing training and updates. Additionally, SFELAPCO expressed gratitude to the public and customers for quickly reporting issues with its power lines, emphasizing that doing so improves service and helps to avert unfortunate events. "We committed to enhancing safety procedures and reducing potential risks in collaboration with utility and telecommunications providers. The power company wants to make the atmosphere safer for service providers and customers by working together and communicating openly," according to SFELAPCO.</p>

            <h2>New Medical Facility Set to Serve Residents of Sto. Tomas and
                Neighboring Towns</h2>
            <p>Sto. Tomas, [Date] â€“ Residents of Sto. Tomas and neighboring
                towns will no longer have to travel far for medical care, as the
                Jose B. Lingad Memorial General Hospital (JBLMGH) is poised to
                open an additional building in this municipality.</p>
            <p>This development follows the signing of the contribution deed
                between the municipal government of Sto. Tomas, JBLMGH, and the
                Department of Health (DOH). The opening of the JBLMGH Ambulatory
                Surgical and Multi-Specialty Center is scheduled for December of
                this year, marking a significant improvement in local healthcare
                services.</p>
            <p>JBLMGH received the lot and building from the Sto. Tomas
                municipal authority to extend its operations in the area. The
                structure, built in 2019 by former Fourth District
                Representative Juan Pablo "Rimpy" Bondoc and Mayor John Sambo,
                was initially planned for the town's community hospital.
                However, its launch was hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic, which
                resulted in lockdowns that prevented it from serving its
                intended purpose. During the pandemic, the structure served as a
                quarantine center.</p>
            <p>Mayor John Sambo expressed his commitment to improving the town's
                healthcare services, stating,
                "Malaki ang magiging tulong nito para maisulong ang serbisyong pangkalusugan sa aming bayan dahil may sarili na kaming ospital na magbibigay ng kalidad at libreng serbisyo."</p>
            <p>Fourth District Representative Anna York Bondoc commented on the
                significance of the JBLMGH extension building, which will serve
                residents around the Fourth District, including Bulacan. She
                also noted that it is JBLMGH's first extension building outside
                its compound in the City of San Fernando.
                "We're very excited about this because we desperately need it,"
                she said.
                "We are all aware that the Fourth District is prone to floods, and we cannot go when it occurs; however, with the launch of the JBL expansion in Sto. Tomas, we will have easier access to its services."</p>
            <p>JBLMGH's medical director, Dr. Monserrat Chichioco, emphasized
                the hospital's services, which will include clinics for medical
                consultations, radiography, laboratory, dental services, and
                pharmacy.
                "Sa tulong ng donation na ito, mas mailalapit natin ang serbisyong medikal mula JBL papunta sa ating mga bayan-bayan para mas marami tayong matulungan,"
                she stated. DOH Undersecretary Eric Tayag and Central Luzon
                Director Corazon Flores were also present for the gift deed
                signing.</p>

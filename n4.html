                She was following the signing of the contribution deed between the municipal government of Sto. Tomas, JBLMGH, and the Department of Health (DOH), on Friday, September 29, 2023, the opening of the JBLMGH Ambulatory Surgical and Multi-Specialty Center was set for December of this year.
            </p>
         <br>
            <p>
                JBLMGH received the lot and building from the Stoâ€”Tomas municipal authority to extend its operations in the area. The structure, built in 2019 by former Fourth District Representative Juan Pablo "Rimpy" Bondoc and Mayor John Sambo, was initially planned for the town's community hospital.

            <p>
                However, its launch was hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in lockdowns that prevented it from serving its intended purpose.
During the pandemic, the structure served as a quarantine center.
Sambo stated that he decided to give the facility to help improve the town's healthcare services.
"Malaki ang magiging tulong nito para maisulong ang serbisyong pangkalusugan sa aming bayan dahil may sarili na kaming ospital na magbibigay ng kalidad at libreng serbisyo," the mayor was quoted as saying.

            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Fourth District Representative Anna York Bondoc stated that the JBLMGH extension building will serve residents around the Fourth District, including Bulacan.
She also stated that it is JBLMGH's first extension building outside its compound in the City of San Fernando.
"We're very excited about this because we desperately need it." We are all aware that the Fourth District is prone to floods, and we cannot go when it occurs; however, with the launch of the JBL expansion in Sto. Tomas, we will have easier access to its services," Bondoc remarked.

            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                JBLMGH's medical director, Dr. Monserrat Chichioco, stated that the hospital will feature clinics for medical consultations, radiography, laboratory, dental services, and pharmacy.
                "Sa tulong ng donation na ito, mas mailalapit natin ang serbisyong medikal mula JBL papunta sa ating mga bayan-bayan para mas marami tayong matulungan," she went on to say.
                DOH Undersecretary Eric Tayag and Central Luzon Director Corazon Flores were also present for the gift deed signing.

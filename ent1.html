        The inaugural National Basketball Championships Inter-High, a nationwide
        search for the best private high school boys basketball team, unfolds on
        Friday, October 13 in Pampanga. Thirty-two provinces, cities, or regions
        will each host eight teams competing for the right to represent their
        province in the grand finals.</p>

        <article>Presented and organized by Jams Sports, a division of Jamsap
        Entertainment Corporation, and with PBA legend and 2013 MVP Arwind
        Santos serving as league Commissioner, the 256-team win-or-go-home boys'
        tournament offers a grand prize of One Million Pesos (P1,000,000) for
        the champion.

        More than anything else, NBCIH will be a platform for 14 to 19-year-olds
        to showcase their basketball skills and potential in front of coaches
        and scouts, potentially leading to athletic scholarship offers from
        colleges and universities across the nation that are always on the
        lookout for fresh, young, and promising talent.
